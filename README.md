### Growth Mindset
To me, having a growth mindset means that you’re willing to learn and improve yourself and your skills everyday.

- **Don’t be afraid of challenges.** To grow, you must get out of your comfort zone.
- **Search for feedbacks and mentors** to lead you on the right path.
- It’s ok to make mistakes and fail as long as you **don’t give up.**
